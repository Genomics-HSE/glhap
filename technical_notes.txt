How json file of tree does look like:

json is set of lists, each lists has form [number, name, mutation1, mutation2, ..., mutationN]
mutation has form discribed in phylotree.


number.
For root number is 0,
For descendants of root number is 0 as well.
For their descendants number 1, for next descendants number is 2, etc.

So, if you see number n>0, then its parent is nearest node above with number n-1.

For convenience, there is renumeration in programm:

------------------
for i in d:
    i[0] += 1
d[0][0]=0
------------------
